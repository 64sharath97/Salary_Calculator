    "\n",
    "The above program basically takes in an input from the user from the list of Employee Ids mentioned on the in the table. Any incorrect attempts other than the ID values in the table will cause a reiteration of taking the input from the user. The input being invalid for more than 3 times will end the program and will request for re-running the program. On a successful entry of the employee id to the input will display the corresponding paystub of the employee with the requisite information of the bonus, tax deductions and net income as per the requirements from the question. \n",
    "\n",
    "------------------------------------------------------Program Detailing--------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution to the above question is answered using OOPS in Python by creating a class called \"PayStub\". The reason being the ability of inheritance in Python which makes it very powerful to pass on the value as well as the memory location of the same variables making better memory optimisation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program uses 3 modules - clear_output, datetime and pandas for clearing the output, genarating the system current date and dataframe creation respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "This method is used to define the initail variables, the data for employees abd taking an input from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Initially, an object of the class - 'obj' is created in order to make parameterized function calls using the instance 'self', as well as to instigate the constructor \"__start__\" from where the program starts to execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) A dataframe called 'dataset' is created to store the details of different employees as per the requirements. The 'id' of the dataframe is set as the index of the dataframe to avoid the serial numbers for better readibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) The variables self.dataset and self.emp_id are initialzed. The variable 'exit' is used as a counter to avoid the user entering multiple wrong inputs for the robustness of the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) The input from the user is revalidated in the while loop for incorrect IDs other than mentioned in the table and incorrect format of the input. The while loop allows a maximum of 3 attempts for the user to give in correct and a required input for generating the paystub of the employee.\n",

    "2)------------------------------------------------------bonus_calculator-------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "This method calculates the annual bonus of the employee according to the slabs in the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "a) After the user provides a correct employee id as an input, the id is passed on to the bonus_calculator. Here depending upon the slab of the employee's annual salary the bonus is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) The use of 'if' conditions splits the salaries of different slabs for different values of bonus calculations per annum of the employee's income.\n",
